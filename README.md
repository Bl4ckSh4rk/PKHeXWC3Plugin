# WC3 Plugin
[PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) plugin to import and export generation 3 event files.
This includes the following:
- Mystery Gifts (WC3) for FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald
- Mystery Events (ME3) for Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald
- e-Card Trainers (ECT) for all generation 3 games
- e-Card Berries (ECB) for all generation 3 games
- Wonder News (WN3) for FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald

All checksums are fixed on import.

If you want to edit any of the files you need to use suloku's [Gen 3 Mystery Gift Tool](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/39184-gen-iii-mystery-gift-tool-nintendo-events-wondercards-e-trainer-cards-and-e-berry-editor-and-more).
